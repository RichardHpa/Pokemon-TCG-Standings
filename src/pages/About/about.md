## About the PTCG Standings

This site was made my myself (Richard Hpa) as a way to track Pokemon tcg tournaments.

Originally build to follow my friends who went along to the 2024 Melbourne Regional Championships, I decided to make it public and extend it to all tournaments which I can get data for. Since the closure of Pokestats, I have been looking for a site which can provide me with the same/similar information, while also having a nice user experience to make it easy to track tournaments.

I hope you find this site useful.

#### Features I want to add

There is a lot I would like to add onto this site, but I am only one person and I have a full time job. To start with, this site only shows information which I can get from the tournament data, and it was only the data I needed/wanted to see to track my friends.

Some features I would like to add are:

-   More detailed information about the tournaments
-   More detailed information about the players
-   Follow specific decks

If you did find the site useful, please let me know. Or even better help me fund it, which could help me add more features and better stability. The best way to do that is to follow the link below and buy me a coffee (since there is no "Buy me pokemon cards" service).

#### I found a bug

This is a personal project and I am the only one working on it. I have tested it as much as I can, but I am only human. If you find a bug, please let me know. You can either open an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/RichardHpa/Pokemon-TCG-Standings) or contact me on [X](https://twitter.com/RichardHpaNZ) (which I have barely used). The more information you can provide, the better (screenshots are great). I imagine there will be a lot of bugs to begin with and I will try to fix them as soon as I can.

The most common error that I have seen is to do with the API and not being able to get a response. If you see that then it is likely just a network error and hopefully a page refresh will fix it.

#### Isn't this just a copy of Pokestats?

Yes and no. Pokestats was a great site which I used to use to track tournaments, but it has since been taken down. I wanted to make a site which was similar to it to but also not be a 1:1 copy.

If pokestats ever comes back online, I will be more than happy to take this site down.

### Special thanks

A very special thanks for [@_JuHlien_](https://twitter.com/_JuHlien_) from [Pokedata](https://pokedata.ovh/) for providing the data for the tournaments via his scrapper.
